"""
Safety net for card orders whose customers never finished paying.

Stripe's ``checkout.session.expired`` webhook normally cancels these and
returns their stock. If webhooks aren't configured (or one was missed),
run this every 15-30 minutes, e.g. as a cron job / scheduled task:

    python manage.py release_unpaid_orders
